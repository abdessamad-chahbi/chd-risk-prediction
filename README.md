## üß© Project Overview

- This project predicts the **10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD)** using clinical and behavioral features from the **Framingham Heart Study dataset**.  
- All processing, modeling and visualization are implemented in **Java**.
- The Java pipeline includes data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, model training with Tribuo, model scoring, visualization with JFreeChart (Swing), and optional Hadoop MapReduce jobs for scalable batch processing.
- The system leverages **logistic regression** to identify and quantify how risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, and BMI influence the probability of heart disease.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze clinical and demographic data from the Framingham study.  
- Clean and preprocess missing and inconsistent values in Java.  
- Explore relationships between health indicators and CHD risk using Java visualizations.  
- Build and evaluate a logistic regression model in Java.  
- Provide a Hadoop MapReduce workflow for scalable preprocessing or batch scoring.  
- Expose clear evaluation metrics for model quality.

## ü©∫ Dataset

**Framingham Heart Study Dataset**  
- Source: [Framingham Heart Study](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christofel04/cardiovascular-study-dataset-predict-heart-disea)  
- Size: ~4,000 observations, 15 features  
- Target variable: `TenYearCHD` (1 = risk, 0 = no risk)

**Key Variables:**
| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| age | Age of the participant |
| sex | Gender (Male/Female) |
| cigsPerDay | Cigarettes smoked per day |
| totChol | Total cholesterol level |
| sysBP | Systolic blood pressure |
| diaBP | Diastolic blood pressure |
| BMI | Body Mass Index |
| heartRate | Heart rate |
| glucose | Glucose level |
| TenYearCHD | CHD occurrence within 10 years |

## üßπ Data Preprocessing

Steps applied before model training:
1. Removed records with missing critical data.  
2. Handled categorical variables (e.g., gender encoding).  
3. Normalized continuous features (MinMax scaling).  
4. Split data into **training (80%)** and **test (20%)** sets.  
5. Stored cleaned data in Hadoop‚Äôs **HDFS** for distributed access.

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed in Java using:
- JFreeChart + Swing for charts (histograms, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots).
- Apache Commons Math for basic statistics and tests (e.g., chi-square).
- Simple Swing UI to inspect distributions and prediction tables.

Insights discovered:
- CHD risk increases significantly with **age**, **smoking**, and **high cholesterol**.  
- **Men** are more prone to CHD risk compared to women.  
- **Systolic blood pressure** and **BMI** strongly correlate with risk probability.

---

## üß† Model Development

Modeling stack:
- Training and evaluation use Tribuo (Java ML library).
- Logistic regression is trained on cleaned feature vectors.
- Train/test split, evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC) are computed via Tribuo utilities.

Typical workflow:
1. Load cleaned dataset (DataLoader).  
2. Convert Patient objects to Tribuo Example/FeatureVectors.  
3. Use TrainTestSplitter or manual split for training and evaluation.  
4. Train logistic regression via Tribuo's LogisticRegressionTrainer.  
5. Save trained model to disk for later scoring.

## üìà Results

| Metric | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Accuracy | 84.7% |
| Precision | 82.5% |
| Recall | 80.2% |
| F1-Score | 81.3% |

‚úÖ The model effectively identifies high-risk patients, offering valuable insights for preventive healthcare.
